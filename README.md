# RTL Design And Synthesis Using Sky130


Welcome to my notes from Week 1 of the RTL Design and Synthesis by VLSI System Design (VSD). This week focused on building a solid foundation in Verilog RTL design, simulation, and the basics of digital circuit synthesis using Sky130 PDK. Iâ€™ve compiled my key learnings and insights below to reinforce the concepts and guide my ongoing practice.

## Prerequisites

- Basic understanding of digital logic (gates, flip-flops, multiplexers, etc.)
- Familiarity with Linux shell commands
- A Linux environment (or WSL on Windows/macOS)
- Tools: `git`, `iverilog`, `gtkwave`, `yosys`, and a text editor

---
## Structure
The repository is organized by day, each with a dedicated folder and README:

- [Day 1: Introduction to Verilog RTL Design & Synthesis](Day_1/README.md)
- [Day 2: Timing Libraries, Synthesis Approaches, and Efficient Flip-Flop Coding](Day_2/README.md)
- [Day 3: Combinational and Sequential Optimization](Day_3/README.md)
- [Day 4: Gate-Level Simulation (GLS), Blocking vs. Non-Blocking in Verilog, and Synthesis-Simulation Mismatch ](Day_4/README.md)
- [Day 5: Optimization in Synthesis ](Day_5/README.md)

Each dayâ€™s README includes:
- Clear explanations of the dayâ€™s concepts
- Step-by-step practical labs with code and screenshots

## Key Takeaways from Week 1

### 1. **Understanding RTL Design Principles**
- **Verilog RTL Modeling:** Learned that RTL (Register Transfer Level) is a hardware description methodology that describes the flow of digital signals between registers and the logical operations performed on those signals.
- **Design Hierarchy:** Emphasized the importance of modular designâ€”building complex systems from smaller, manageable modules.
- **Coding Styles:** Discovered different coding styles for flip-flops, such as using `always @(posedge clk)` blocks, which are essential for synchronous designs.

## My Notes and Insights

- **Design Workflow:** The typical flow Iâ€™m learning involves writing RTL â†’ simulating with testbenches â†’ synthesizing with Yosys â†’ analyzing waveforms and debugging.
- **Importance of Clear Coding Practices:** Proper naming conventions and modular code make debugging and future modifications much easier.
- **Open-Source Ecosystem:** Sky130 and Yosys are powerful tools that democratize hardware design, making it accessible for students and hobbyists.

## Next Steps

- Deepen my understanding of timing libraries and their impact on synthesis.
- Experiment with different flip-flop coding styles to optimize for area and speed.
- Continue practicing testbench creation to improve verification skills.

This initial week has laid a strong foundation for my RTL design journey. I look forward to applying these concepts in more complex designs and exploring optimization techniques in the upcoming weeks!
